        Sinigang is a popular Filipino soup known for its savory and tangy
        flavor, traditionally made with tamarind as the souring agent. This
        comforting dish typically includes pork, shrimp, or fish, simmered with
        vegetables like radish, eggplant, okra, and water spinach. Its signature
        sour broth, often flavored with tamarind, gives it a refreshing and
        appetizing taste that pairs perfectly with steamed rice.
